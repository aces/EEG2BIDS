# React Development

 * EEG2BIDS/src/App.js is the starting point of react.
 * EEG2BIDS/src/jsx is where the main view components of the app exist.
 * EEG2BIDS/src/jsx/elements is where useful components exist for repeated tasks.

## Things to remember:

Code is constantly evolving and that's definitely true for React at this time of writing.
Please use React Hooks to achieve cleaner code and by using functional components instead of class components when possible!
