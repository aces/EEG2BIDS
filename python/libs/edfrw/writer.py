        Signals are allowed to be acquired at different sampling rates.
        The data are saved in data blocks (named 'data records' in the
        specification). The total number of samples in the block is thus
        determined by adding the sizes of the individiual signals
        (`signal.number_of_samples_in_data_record`).

        Each data block holds all data aquired during a time interval of
        `header.duration_of_data_record` seconds, and the total number
        of data records in the file are `header.number_of_data_records`.

        Thus, to write a data block (data record), the data must be
        the concatenation of samples acquired during the period of time
        `duration_of_data_record` first all samples from signal 0, then
        signal 1, etc.
